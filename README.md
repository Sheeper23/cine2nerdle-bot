# Cine2Nerdle Battles Bot

This project is a bot which connects to Cine2Nerdle battles servers via websocket and plays a match with perfect precision. Running logs may be followed in the console and in the local `log.txt` text file. Username and opening play may be customized, but you must know the Cine2Nerdle movie ID for your new opening play.

## To Run:
Create a Python virtual environment (if you wish)\
\
Install required packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run `bot.py`
```bash
python bot.py
```
